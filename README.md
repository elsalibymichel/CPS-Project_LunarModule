# CPS-Project_LunarModule

This repository contains the materials needed to reproduce the project we did for the Cyber Physica Systems exam held by Prof. Laura Nenzi.

See ```report.pdf`` for a detailed description of the problem and the designed solution.

We also provide in this repo:
- ```DQN.py`` contains a class for training a DQN
- ```Falsification.py`` contains a class for falsifying the model
- Test.ipynb`` contains the code for running the experiments, i.e. training and falsifying a model.
- ```Lander_5000_64x2_0.6_64.h5`` is the model we got from training.
- ```Falsification gif`` is a folder containing videos of the experiments that falsified the specifications.
