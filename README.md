# CPS-Project_LunarModule

This repository contains the materials needed to reproduce the project that we made for the exame of Cyber Physica Systems held by Prof. Laura Nenzi.

See ```report.pdf``` for a detailed description of the problem and the designed solution.

In addition, in this repo we provide:
- ```DQN.py``` contains a class for training a DQN
- ```Falsification.py``` contains a class for falsifying the model
- ```Test.ipynb``` contains the code for running the experiments, i.e., training and falsifying a model
- ```Lander_5000_64x2_0.6_64.h5``` is the model that we obtained from the training
- ```Falsification gif``` is a folder that contains video of the teajectories that had faslified the specifications
